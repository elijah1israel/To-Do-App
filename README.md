# MyTodoApp

A modern React Native To Do app with categories, due dates, reminders, subtasks, priorities, filters, and a polished UI.

This repository contains a small, self-contained To Do application built with React Native + TypeScript. It focuses on useful productivity features and a clean mobile-first UI.

## Highlights
- Group tasks by category (personal, work, school, other)
- Due dates and time (specify date + time in the advanced add modal)
- Live countdown to due time shown on the task card
- Recurring task metadata (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Priority (low / medium / high)
- Subtasks with per-task progress bar
- Filters, search, and progress tracking
- Modern dark UI with a floating action button (FAB) and an advanced add modal

## Screenshots
Replace the placeholder images in `assets/screenshots/` with actual screenshots from your device/simulator.

## Quick start
Requirements: Node >= 20, npm, React Native CLI, Xcode (macOS) or Android Studio.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd MyTodoApp
npm install
```

2. iOS only: install pods

```bash
cd ios
npx pod-install
cd ..
```

3. Run on iOS simulator

```bash
npm run ios
```

Run on Android

```bash
npm run android
```

4. Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

## File overview
- `App.tsx` â€” app entry, renders `TodoScreen`
- `src/screens/TodoScreen.tsx` â€” main UI and list
- `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` â€” card UI for each todo
- `src/hooks/useTodos.ts` â€” local todo store + persistence (AsyncStorage)
- `src/components/AdvancedAddModal.tsx` â€” advanced add modal (date/time, category, priority)
- `__tests__/*` â€” a small Jest test and AsyncStorage mock

## How to replace screenshots
1. On iOS simulator: press Command+S or use the `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot` command.
2. On Android emulator: use the emulator toolbar or `adb exec-out screencap -p > screen.png`.
3. Save images to `assets/screenshots/` and keep the same filenames or update the README image paths.

## Next steps (suggestions)
- Add local scheduled notifications for due dates (requires native notification library).
- Add persistent category management and color assignment.
- Add remote sync (Supabase/Firebase) for cross-device sync.

If you want, I can: add real screenshots, wire up native pickers or notifications, or build a simple CI workflow.

Made with care â€” enjoy your new To Do app ðŸ˜„
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes â€”Â this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
